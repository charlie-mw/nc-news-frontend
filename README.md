## Northcoders News API

## Summary of project 

This project built an API for accessing application data, in the form of a blog/article based site. The backend created provides the necessary information for the frontend application. The backend uses JavaScript, SQL and Express, and implements a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations. Express was used to handle client requests, and SQL was used for database management to allow for storage and manipulation of data. Testing was incoroporated using JEST in order to improve code reliability, as well as to ensure that test cases covered the interactions with the API endpoints.
